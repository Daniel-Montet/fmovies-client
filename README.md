I got bored and decided to create a clone of the famous movie piracy website fmovies.

## Getting Started

First, clone repo and install dependancies,:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Running development server

RUN
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
